# Stack Project

We created an API with nested attributes that would be used by the Front End half of our group.
In attempts to create a StackOverflow-like site, we provided the information FE could use on their site.
Though originally we had two different types of votes tables, in the end we settled for a single | and made use of polymorphic associations.
